# Darm

Efficient state-machine based disassembler for the **full** ARMv7 instruction
set, *including* Thumb, Thumb2, and **VFP**/**Neon**/**SIMD**.

This is a complete rewrite of the now-obsolete old darm project. It features
support for the entire ARMv7 instruction set, is very strict and therefore
accurate, has a minimal code base, and has been optimized for speed.

# License

The darm library is released under the **BSD 3-Clause License**, also known
as **BSD Simplified**.
